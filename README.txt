Project Title:

Automated Data Migration Pipeline using Apache Airflow

Project Description:

This project aims to design and implement an automated data migration pipeline using Apache Airflow to transfer data seamlessly from one database to another. The pipeline will extract data using SQL queries from a source database, transform and clean the data if needed, and load it into a target database table efficiently and reliably.

The process will ensure data consistency, integrity, and traceability, supporting both incremental and full-load migration scenarios.

Key Objectives:

Extract data from the source database using parameterized SQL queries.

Transform data (if necessary) to match the schema and format of the target database.

Load the processed data into the target database table.

Automate scheduling and execution using Apache Airflow DAGs.

Ensure fault tolerance and logging for monitoring and error handling.

Technology Stack:

Apache Airflow — For workflow orchestration and scheduling.

Python — For writing Airflow tasks and transformation logic.

MySQL / PostgreSQL / MongoDB — Source and target databases (configurable).

SQLAlchemy / pymysql / psycopg2 — For database connections.

Docker (optional) — To containerize and deploy the pipeline.

Workflow Overview (ETL DAG):

Start → Extract Task

Connect to the source DB

Execute the SQL query

Fetch and temporarily store data (in memory or file)

Transform Task (optional)

Clean, normalize, or map fields if needed

Load Task

Insert data into the target database table

Validation Task

Compare row counts or hash values to ensure migration accuracy

End / Notification

Send success/failure alert via email or logging

Example Use Case:

Migrate “current_owners” table data from an old MySQL database to a new production database.

Only include rows with specific conditions (e.g., citizen_type = 'recipient' AND cu_on_id IS NULL).

Run daily at midnight to sync updated records automatically.

Expected Outcome:

A fully automated Airflow pipeline that securely and efficiently transfers data between databases.

Reduced manual effort and minimal downtime during migration.

Scalable, reusable workflow adaptable for future ETL or data sync tasks.
